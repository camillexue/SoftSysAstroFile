# Making a File System with C
Camille Xue, April 1, 2019

## Project Description
For my second Software Systems project, I will be using C to create a file system. My lower bound for the project is to create a simple file system that can create, read, and write data on the disk, incorporates data structures like inodes and directories. I will explore different algorithms for implementing allocation, directories, and free space management. For my stretch goal I would want to make a more robust file system that is capable of protecting against certain errors or failures, such as data loss. I would also explore ways to improve the performance of my file system, which could involve caching and buffering.

## Learning Goals
I want to solidify my understanding of how file systems work and how specific data structures are used to keep track of information. I also want to learn about more about interacting with data in memory versus disk storage. Additionally, I want to build on my understanding of blocks and allocation from my first project.

## Resources
[MIT File System Lab](http://web.mit.edu/6.033/1997/handouts/html/04sfs.html)
* Resource given from project page
* Gives cursory overview of disk and file system implementation
* No source code to build off of

[University of Notre Dame Lab Version 1](https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.30341.fa17/project06.html) / [Version 2](https://www3.nd.edu/~dthain/courses/cse30341/spring2017/project6/)
* Good graphics explaining overview and file system design
* Source code included
* Detailed explanation of implementation

[UIC File System Implementation](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/11_FileSystemImplementation.html)
* A LOT of detail about all of the aspects of file system implementation
* Very ugly website
* Describes different methods and data structures to use for various parts of implementation

Are there any specific books that I could find in the Olin library that cover file systems in detail?

## First Steps
* Read through the initial resources found
* Draw diagrams of file system design
* Find more resources / learn more about disk emulation
* Create a project timeline / checkpoints
